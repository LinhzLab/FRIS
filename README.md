The programs are the files named simulation_setting.R, FRIS.R, example.R, respectively, which include the all R codes that produce the data of simulation, initial value, FRIS algorithm in the paper and Supporting Information.

The programs contain three parts:

simulation_setting.R: Generate all simulation data.

FRIS.R:  initial value and FRIS  program.

example.R: An example code.
